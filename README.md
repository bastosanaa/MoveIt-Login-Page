# My First Java + Angular Project

This project was created following Kippler's tutorial and serves as an introduction to full-stack development using Java for the backend and Angular for the frontend.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Backend**: Java (Spring Boot)
- **Database**: H2 (local persistence)

## Features

- User registration and login
- Authentication and private page protection with `AuthGuard`
- Data persistence using the H2 database


 (to function correctly, the backend should run on port 8080, and the frontend on port 4200).
